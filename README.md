Git management and troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

User
i was using private github repositories without issue locally! but today i've changed my personal access token on github , and all of a sudden all my local private git repos are showing following error:

remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository not found

is there any way that i can register my personal access token to locally so that all my private git repos work without problem, or did i do something wrong in the beginning?

ChatGPT
It sounds like you need to update the credentials that your local Git client is using to authenticate with GitHub. When you changed your personal access token on GitHub, your old token that was stored locally is no longer valid, hence the authentication failures and the "repository not found" errors.

Here’s how you can update your local setup to use the new personal access token:

1. Update your Git credentials
Depending on your OS and how Git was configured, your token may be stored in a credential manager or directly in the repository configuration.

For macOS:
The macOS Keychain usually manages GitHub credentials. You can update your token here:
Open Keychain Access.
Search for github.com.
Find the entry (it should be a web form password or Internet password).
Update the password field with your new token.
For Windows:
Credentials are typically managed by the Windows Credential Manager.
Open Credential Manager from the Control Panel.
Go to Windows Credentials.
Find the entry for git:https://github.com.
Update the entry with your new token.
For Linux:
If you're using a credential helper, such as git-credential-store or git-credential-cache, you can update your credentials via command line:
bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --global credential.helper store
2. Using the Git Command Line
You can also update your token directly for each repository using the command line:

First, make sure Git prompts you for the username and password:
bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset credential.helper
Next time you push or pull, Git will ask for your credentials, and you can input your username and your new personal access token as the password.
3. Update Your Repository URLs (if necessary)
Ensure your repository URLs are using the HTTPS protocol, as SSH does not use personal access tokens:

Check the current URL:
bash
Copy code
git remote -v
If it’s not using HTTPS, switch to HTTPS by updating the remote URL:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
Replace username and repo with your GitHub username and repository name.
4. Verify Authentication
After updating, try pulling from your repository:
bash
Copy code
git pull
This will confirm whether the new token is working properly.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the authentication issues and continue working with your repositories. If you continue to experience issues, make sure that the token you generated has the appropriate scopes/permissions.

 git config --global --unset credential.helper                                             1 ✘
warning: credential.helper has multiple values
ChatGPT
The warning credential.helper has multiple values indicates that multiple credential helpers have been set in your Git configuration. This can happen if you've configured Git to use different credential helpers at different levels (local, global, system) or multiple entries were added to the global configuration.

To resolve this and ensure your new personal access token is used, you might want to clear all credential helper settings and then reconfigure one that will use your new token. Here's how you can do that:

Clearing Multiple Credential Helpers
List Current Configurations
First, check what credential helpers are configured:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get-all credential.helper
Remove Each Credential Helper
If the above command lists multiple helpers, you'll need to unset each one individually. You can do this by repeating the unset command for each helper listed:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset credential.helper
Run this command multiple times until all entries are removed.

Set a New Credential Helper
After clearing the old settings, set a new credential helper that will prompt you to enter your credentials, which can then be saved:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper cache
cache is a simple helper that temporarily stores credentials in memory for a short time.
Alternatively, you can use store to save credentials to a plain text file on disk:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Updating Credentials
After you've set up the credential helper, the next time you interact with the remote repository (e.g., git push or git pull), Git should prompt you for your username and password. Enter your GitHub username and use your personal access token as the password. This will store the new token in your selected credential storage method.

Ensure Security
If you choose store, be aware that your token will be stored in plain text. Ensure your computer is secure and consider using a more secure method if necessary.
Regularly review your token's permissions and regenerate it if you suspect it has been compromised.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with multiple credential helpers and update your Git configuration to use your new personal access token effectively.

User
when i run this command: git config --global --get-all credential.helper

getting the following output:
store
store

how to remove them?
ChatGPT
The output you see, with two store entries for the credential.helper, indicates that the store credential helper has been set multiple times in your global Git configuration. To remove these duplicate entries, you'll need to use the --unset command for each instance that appears.

Here’s how you can remove the duplicated store entries:

1. Unset Multiple Entries
Since you have two store entries, you need to run the unset command twice to remove each one:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --global --unset credential.helper
Run the --unset command as many times as needed until all duplicate entries are removed. Each execution of the command removes one instance of the configuration.

2. Verify the Configuration
After running the commands to unset the credential helpers, verify that all entries have been removed:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get-all credential.helper
This command should not return any output if all entries have been successfully removed.

3. Reconfigure Credential Helper (if desired)
Once the duplicates are removed, you can reconfigure a single credential helper. Here are a couple of options:

Use store to save credentials on disk:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Use cache to temporarily cache credentials in memory:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper cache
4. Using Your Personal Access Token
After configuring the credential helper, the next time you interact with GitHub (via commands like git push or git pull), you should be prompted to enter your username and password. Use your GitHub username and your new personal access token as the password. This information will then be stored according to the method you set with the credential.helper configuration.

This should help you manage and update your GitHub credentials correctly in your local Git configuration. If any more issues arise, feel free to ask for further assistance.

i ran the following command several times! but keep getting the same log!:
warning: credential.helper has multiple values
ChatGPT
It appears that the standard method of unsetting the credential helper isn't effectively clearing the multiple entries due to how they are stored in your Git configuration. This can sometimes occur if the values are set in different layers (local, global, system) or there are stubborn entries that aren't being removed by the usual commands.

Here's a more direct approach to fully clear and reset your credential helper configuration:

Step-by-Step Manual Editing of Git Config
1. Edit the Global Git Configuration Directly
You can manually edit the global Git configuration file to remove the duplicate entries:

Open the global Git configuration file in a text editor. This file is typically located at ~/.gitconfig on macOS and Linux, or %USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig on Windows.
You can also open this file directly from the command line:
bash
Copy code
git config --global --edit
2. Look for the [credential] Section
In the editor, locate the [credential] section. It might look something like this:

csharp
Copy code
[credential]
    helper = store
    helper = store
3. Remove Duplicate Entries
Manually delete the duplicate helper = store lines so that only one remains, or remove them entirely if you plan to reset them differently.
Save the file and close the editor.
4. Verify the Changes
After editing and saving the file, run the following command to ensure no duplicate entries are left:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get-all credential.helper
This should now show only one entry or none, depending on your edit.

5. Reconfigure the Credential Helper (Optional)
If you have removed all entries and wish to set up the credential helper again, you can add back the preferred credential storage method:

For storing credentials on disk:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
For caching credentials temporarily:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper cache
Additional Tip
If you are using multiple Git configurations (system, global, local), it might be helpful to check each layer to ensure there are no unexpected settings overriding or duplicating what you manage globally. You can view these with:
bash
Copy code
git config --list --show-origin
This command shows where each config setting is coming from, helping you identify and resolve conflicts.
By directly editing the config file or reviewing where each setting originates, you should be able to resolve issues with multiple credential helper values more definitively. If further issues persist, it may be useful to explore the specific configurations at each level (system, global, local) as described.

ok i successfully remove duplicates and after running :
git config --global --edit:

[credential]
         helper = store
 [safe]
       directory = /sources
[user]
name = 
password = 

but how to store my github personal access token? 
ChatGPT
To store your GitHub personal access token securely in your Git configuration, you can use the credential.helper setting along with the store helper. This will securely store your token on your local machine so you don't have to enter it every time you interact with GitHub. Here's how you can do it:

Run the Command:
Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
This sets the credential helper to store, which will store your credentials in plaintext in a local file.

Store Your Token:
After setting the credential helper, the next time you interact with a remote repository on GitHub, Git will prompt you to enter your username and password. Use your GitHub username as the username, and enter your personal access token as the password when prompted.

Automatic Storage:
Once you've entered your username and token, Git will automatically store these credentials in a plaintext file on your local machine, usually in ~/.git-credentials on Linux and macOS, or %USERPROFILE%\.git-credentials on Windows.

Verify the Storage:
You can verify that your token has been stored by checking the contents of the .git-credentials file. You can open it with a text editor to see if your GitHub credentials are stored there.

Optional: Secure Storage:
Storing credentials in plaintext can be insecure, especially on shared or public machines. If security is a concern, consider using a more secure credential helper or enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your GitHub account.

By following these steps, your GitHub personal access token should be securely stored on your local machine, allowing you to interact with your private repositories without having to enter your credentials each time. Remember to keep your personal access token confidential and avoid sharing it with others.

User
there is no any git-credentials on macos ! does that mean it didn't work correctly?! how can i store credentials manually?!
ChatGPT
If you don't see a .git-credentials file and you've configured the store credential helper, it could mean that you haven't yet attempted to authenticate with GitHub since setting it, or there could be an issue with how the credentials were supposed to be stored. On macOS, you might also be using a different credential management system like the macOS Keychain, depending on your Git configuration.

To manually store your credentials in the .git-credentials file, you can follow these steps:

Manually Creating the .git-credentials File
Locate or Create the File:

Open Terminal.
Check if the file exists in your home directory with ls -la ~. If it’s not visible, you can create it manually.
Use a text editor to open or create this file. You can use nano for this purpose:
bash
Copy code
nano ~/.git-credentials
Enter Your Credentials:

Add a line in the following format:
perl
Copy code
https://<username>:<personal_access_token>@github.com
Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <personal_access_token> with your actual token.
Save the file and exit the editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + X, then pressing Y to confirm, and Enter to save.
Configure Git to Use the store Helper:

If not already done, set Git to use the store credential helper:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
This tells Git to look for credentials in the .git-credentials file.
Test Your Setup:

Try running a Git command that requires authentication, like git fetch or git push, on any of your repositories.
If everything is set up correctly, Git should not prompt for your username or password.
Additional Security Consideration
Storing your credentials in plaintext (as in the .git-credentials file) can pose a security risk, especially if others have access to your computer or if your device is lost or stolen. Here are a couple of alternatives for safer handling:

Use the macOS Keychain: macOS users can use the Keychain to securely store and manage passwords. You can configure Git to use the macOS Keychain by running:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
The next time Git prompts you for your username and password, macOS will save these in the Keychain and manage them securely.

Environment Variables: For scripting or development environments, consider using environment variables to store sensitive information temporarily.

By following these steps, you can manually add your credentials to the .git-credentials file and ensure Git uses them for repository access. However, always consider the security implications of storing sensitive information in plaintext.

User
after all settings still having the issue?!

~/.git-credentials:
  https://

~/.gitconfig:
  1 [credential]
  2         helper = store
  3 [safe]
  4         directory = /sources
  5 [user]
  6         name = 
  7         password = 
ChatGPT
Given the configuration you've shared and the persistent issues, let's address a few potential problems and correct any misconfigurations:

Configuration Settings Review

Your .git-credentials and .gitconfig appear to be correctly set up. However, the password entry under [user] in .gitconfig is not standard and will not be used by Git for authentication. This entry can be removed to avoid any confusion.
Remove Unnecessary Password Entry

Open your global .gitconfig file:
bash
Copy code
git config --global --edit
Delete the line that contains password =  or comment it out by adding a # at the beginning of the line.
Save and close the file.
Ensure URL is Correct

Verify that the URL in the .git-credentials file is correct. Make sure there are no typos in the username or token. Also, ensure that the personal access token (token) is still valid and has not been revoked or expired.
Permissions of Personal Access Token

Log into your GitHub account and check the permissions assigned to your personal access token. Ensure it has the appropriate scopes, such as repo, admin:org, user, etc., depending on your needs.
Test Your Git Configuration

Try cloning a repository to see if Git now uses the stored credentials without error:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/your-repository.git
Replace your-repository.git with the actual repository path. This operation should not ask for a username or password if everything is configured correctly.
Check for SSH vs. HTTPS

Ensure that your repository is configured to use HTTPS URLs rather than SSH. The token will not work with SSH URLs. Check this with:
bash
Copy code
git remote -v
If the output shows SSH URLs (git@github.com:...), you need to change them to HTTPS:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/your-repository.git
Check for Network Issues
